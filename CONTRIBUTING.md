#CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES
We value your contributions in whatever form. 
Please stick to the following basic principles: 
##Contributing issues
When opening a new issue please 
* search for duplicates
* describe clearly which behavior you get and what you were expecting
##Contributing code
Please submit a Pull Request if you want to contribute changes to the source code. 

Your Pull Request should:
* include a description that tells us, what it does 
* include commit messages that describe the commits
* include tests, because we want to make sure, we're not breaking your contribution with changes at a later date. A test
coverage of 80% would be desirable
* follow the [coding style](https://github.com/viadee/vPAV/wiki/Coding-guidelines)
