# Configuration
The viadee Process Application Validator can be configured in different ways. 
[Properties](Properties.md) contain general settings. 
The [rule set](RuleSet.md) configures which consistency checks are performed.
If model errors are recognized during the checks which are false positives, they can be [excluded](Configuration/FalsePositives.md). 
[Defining variables](UserVariables.md) is an advanced way to prevent errors caused by variables which are not found by the vPAV yet.
